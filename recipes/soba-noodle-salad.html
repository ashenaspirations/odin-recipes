        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>
            In this recipe, earthy Japanese soba noodles are tossed in a simple honey-soy dressing and garnished with green onions, cilantro, and sesame seeds. Simple yet bright in flavors, this salad is a true favorite of mine.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>7 oz dried soba noodles</li>

            <li>1 handful of cilantro</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For the dressing</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp roasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp crushed red pepper</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp honey</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp soy sauce</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Gather all the ingredients.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    To make the dressing, combine the vegetable oil, sesame oil, and crushed red peppers in a small saucepan.
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Whisk it all together and infuse the oil over medium heat for 3 minutes. Alternatively, you can put these ingredients in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 3 minutes. Set aside to let it cool a bit; be careful while handling as it'll get very hot.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Add the honey and soy sauce to the oil mixture.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Whisk it all together until the honey has completely dissolved.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Bring water to a boil in a large pot (you do not need to salt the water for cooking soba). Cook the soba noodles according to the package instructions, but make sure they are al dente. Drain into a colander and rinse the soba noodles under cold running water. This step is important to remove the excess starch from the noodles and to stop the cooking. Drain well and transfer to a large bowl.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Thinly slice the green onions and chop the cilantro into small pieces.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Add the dressing, green onions, cilantro, and sesame seeds to the bowl with the soba noodles.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Toss everything together. Transfer to a serving bowl or plate. Serve chilled or at room temperature.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
