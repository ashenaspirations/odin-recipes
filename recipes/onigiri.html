        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>
            Onigiri (おにぎり), sometimes called Nigirimeshi (握り飯) or Omusubi (おむすび), is a Japanese rice ball. Typically shaped into a triangle, but sometimes a cylinder or round shape, onigiri has been Japan’s lunch and snack options for centuries.

            Onigiri’s rich history can be dated back almost 2,000 years to the Yayoi Period (200 B.C. to A.D. 250) when we see reference to grilled rice balls made from sticky rice. In the Nara Period (710-794), the word nigiri-ii (握飯) is used for packed rice. Tonjiki (屯食) refers to rice balls for picnics during the Heian Period (794-1185), and this is the origin of the present onigiri shape. Samurai ate umeboshi (pickled plum) rice balls during the Kamakura Period (1185-1333). We don’t see nori being used as a wrapper until the Edo Period (1603-1868).

            The Japanese eat countless onigiri growing up and still continue to eat as an adult: It’s a true comfort food to many.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>3 cups cooked Japanese short-grain rice</li>
            <li>4 oz cooked salmon</li>
            <li>5 shiso leaves</li>
            <li>3 myoga ginger</li>
            <li>1 1/2 Tbsp shio kombu</li>
            <li>2 tsp toasted white sesame seeds</li>
            <li>2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Cut off the stems of the shiso leaves and roll them up from the stem side. Cut into julienned strips. Loosen them up with your hands and set aside.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Cut the myoga ginger (optional) in half lengthwise and then cut it into thin slices.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Distribute the shiso and myoga ginger over the hot steamed rice.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Distribute the shio kombu, sesame seeds, and cooked salmon over the rice.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Using a rice paddle, use a slicing motion to gently mix all the ingredients into the rice. Take care not to mash the rice grains.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Prepare a sheet of plastic, about 10 inches by 12 inches. Sprinkle some kosher salt (remember, salt is used here to preserve the rice for a long time) in the middle of the plastic. Scoop the rice mixture and place it in the center of the plastic wrap on top of the salt. Gather the corners of the plastic wrap and twist the plastic a few times to tighten it around the rice. Tip: Onigiri should weigh about 3-4 oz (85-113 g) each. I usually make three 3 oz (85 g) rice balls to fit into my kids' lunch boxes.</p>
